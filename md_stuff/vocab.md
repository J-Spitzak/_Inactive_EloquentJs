1. fault tolerance 
    - google: "a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components"
    - fault tolerance is simply a systems resiliance to faliure
    - in engineering this means if a moving part fails can the machine still run 
    - in networks that means if one part fails thing can be rerouted
    - the question was about the internet
2. personally identifiable information
    - "Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom..."
    - "the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means"
    - tldr: if the information may in some way pinpoint the identity of the user even if...
    - it requires other information or statistics then it is personally identifiable
3. bandwidth
    - wiki: bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path
    - whenever information is accessed from a location outside of where it is stored...
    - it must be transferred by some means and the rate of transfer is bandwidth
4. encryption
    - wiki: encryption is the process of encoding information
    - encryption is similar to compression except that it has...
    - the goal of concealing info instead of shrinking it
5. asymetric encryption
    - asymetric encryption involves 2 keys, one public and one private
    - the private key is used to decrypt messages encrypted by the public key
6. symetric encryption
    - involves only 1 key used to both encrypt and decrypt information
7. binary overflow
    - bbc: when adding two binary numbers we can end up with an extra digit that doesn't fit
    - 010 represents 2, 100 represents 4, if added they produce 110 or 6
    - if 110 (6) and 011 (3) are added they produce 9 or 1001
    - but if only 3 bits are used like in all previose examples there is no space for the 4th bit
8. lossless compression
    - wiki: data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed
    - @y went @re to see @ #ers # @ game, if @ = the and # = play.
    - in this example the sentence can be perfectly reconstucted despite the smaller size
9. lossy compression
    - wiki: data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content
    - ftbll plyrs ar alwys rdy t ply
    - in this example you cannot perfectly reconstuct the sentence
    - but the sentence is compressed cleverly in places where we can still have a good idea of content of the origional sentence
10. bias
    - wiki: disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing
    - bias is a cognitive effect the brain has that deals with information based on opinions, ther are many kinds
    - confirmation bias: somebody is more likely to take something as true if it supports their opinion
    - false consensus: people are likely to think that there is greater support for their ideals then reality
    - there are many more but one way biased is solved is to have multiple viewpoints
