## q1: investigate the metadata from a chart created in google trends
###  we chose a chart of the programming language python
### here is the metadata we found:
- the search term (in our case python)
- the topic (in our case it was a programming language)
- the region specified (in our case we were looking at the US)
- the timeframe (in our case it was a year)
## q2: choose a dataset from code.org and investigate that metadata and record our findings
### the dataset we have chosen is dogs
### here is the metadata we found:
- the id of the collumn (ex: name, breed group, maximum life span, etc...)
- the title of the dataset (dogs)
- for each collumn the datatype may be contained (ex: height - integer, bred for - string)
- possibly the length of the list
## q3: is there metadata that you would like to have that isn't provided
- for google trends it would be nice if it gave absolute information instead of relative information
